    "# Smallpond Lightweight Analytics at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "In today‚Äôs data landscape, teams often face a trade-off between simplicity and scale. Traditional analytics stacks can be heavy, costly, and complex to get started, especially when the goal is to move fast and process big data efficiently. Smallpond bridges that gap by focusing on:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö° Speed ‚Äî Fast setup and minimal overhead for transformation of big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "üì¶ Simplicity ‚Äî Simple interfaces and modular components that just work.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚òÅÔ∏è Scalability ‚Äî Designed to handle distributed data workloads seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß© Interoperability ‚Äî Works with common data formats and integrates smoothly with existing tools like pandas and duckdb.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we‚Äôll explore how Smallpond can be used to build lightweight, high-performance transformation pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first we need to setup the environment and infrastructure to really test it's functionality"
